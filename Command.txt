this is the command to change your username in git.
git config user.name "Ranjeet_INFO"
Explanation: This command updates the Git username specifically for this repository by adding _INFO at the end of the username.

git add Command.txt
git commit -m "Added Command.txt with Git username update documentation"


git status

This command shows:
- Which files are tracked/untracked
- Which files have changes
- Which files are staged for commit
- The current branch we're working on

I checked the repository state to see all tracked and untracked files and changes that need to be committed.
